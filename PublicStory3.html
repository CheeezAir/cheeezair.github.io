<h1 id = "title">The Tale of Realm of the Mad God</h1>
<p class = "phase">Noob: </p>
<p>After rehearsal, one of the boys at my ballet school asked what games I played. </p>
<p class="quotes">
    “Fire Boy and Water Girl, Plants vs Zombies, Pokemon Platinum, Jetpack Joyride, Tiny Tower-” <br>
	“No, I mean MMO games.”<br>
	“I play Tanki?”<br>
    “Oh that crappy tank game? Anyways you should play Realm of the Mad God!”<br>
</p>
<p>I considered it, but then was too lazy to make an account. It wasn’t until 4 months later when he brought it up again that I made an account. The game itself wasn’t very fun. I would keep hitting a black border and my hp wouldn’t fall when I got hit, then suddenly I’d die. But this wasn’t like Minecraft where you could just get your items back or cheat them back in, this was permadeath—permanent death—that character was gone. This was also my first touch with extreme lag. </p>
<p>I didn’t touch the game for a month. Soon enough he asked again if I wanted to play together. We both got on a call and I found him in game and he taught me everything. First, he told me not to get scared of him, this was a cooperative game where no pvp occurred. Then he taught me about the classes and each of their unique traits, the pot system, and tier system. He told me to start watching videos for guides on how to play the game well. There must’ve been lag-reducing updates because I only saw the black tiles when there were 3 enemies or other players on screen at once instead of all the time. This wasn’t a big improvement though, ROTMG is a bullet hell game where there are shots flying about from every direction from tons of enemies and players. I remember that towards the end of our call, he asked me what items I had and, after showing him the trash tier 1 items I had, he gave me tier 10 equipment. Now, with my t14 equips I scoff at those meager numbers, but at the time I treasured those items. </p>
<p class = "phase">Mediocre: </p>
<p>The fast xp gain and the quick obtaining of items were extremely addicting. Even though I’d constantly die and say I’d never come back to the game after losing everything, I’d always come back and start all over again. I must’ve died over 200 times before maxing my first stat. There are 8 stats in ROTMG and when all the stats are maxed, your character is very powerful. However, even maxing 1 stat is difficult, one must drink 5 to 34 potions of the same type. To obtain these potions, you had to do specific dungeons over and over and grind them. It seemed so repetitive, but you never knew when you’d slip up and suddenly die. Getting this first maxed stat was amazing, but ultimately I died within an hour of getting there and had to restart from scratch all over again.</p>
<p>ROTMG is a very pay to win game. I had 1 character slot and 1 vault chest (vaults are for storing items; they do not disappear if a character dies and store a max of 8 items) and the only way to get more at the time was to pay money. This was also a time when ROTMG was dying, there was only 1 person actively working on the game and only 1 update that year. Either way, I was having fun. </p>
<p class = "phase">Amateur: </p>
<p>	My dad had recently upgraded his computer, so you know what that means, I took the opportunity to upgrade from a bulky mac air to a sleeker Toshiba machine. The performance increased drastically, now I could load in 5 players or enemies before seeing the lag tiles. Since I’d die so much, I’d trade all my acquired items onto “mules.” Accounts that did nothing but store items were called “mules” and they were the free way to get more “vault” space because you could just trade back the items when you needed them which albeit broke the TOS—terms of service—but who cares.</p>
<p>I was watching a lot of videos on ROTMG and wanted to make my own youtube channel. It would consist of ROTMG let’s plays and I wanted it to be with my friends. My nickname at the time was ______ and my best friends were Ayush and Ivan. So the name was ______Air; the “air” stood for A(yush) I(van) R(ichard). In the end, Ivan’s parents were very strict on video games so all the videos only had me and Ayush in them. Our videos are the cringiest things I’ve ever made in my life, our voices were energetic and very high and we were very loud. Still, those times were filled with fun for me. We only made a couple videos and I wrote a ROTMG themed song. </p>
<p class = "phase">Practiced: </p>
<p>Now, this game is a game and by such my parents were not happy that it was consuming a lot of my time. So I had to develop extreme mechanical proficiency. My ability to switch tabs is now godly because of this era. However, my parents still caught me multiple times. It became so common to hide playing from our parents that when my friends and I played and our parents didn’t know, we would call it being “illegal.” Soon enough, my dad put a block on games in our internet. I was devastated, but found a work around: I would go to my friend’s house, load up a bunch of tabs, then I could play at my home. Even if I had to close a tab due to lag I could just go to the next tab.</p>
<p>I clearly remember one time playing illegally and dying on a very good character with 6 stats maxed. I had to swallow the pain that engulfed me and not freak out. Soon enough my parents caught wind of my addiction and Ayush’s parents caught wind of his. So one day, my mom dragged me over to Ayush’s house and our mom’s chastised us about our addictions. And that made us stop playing as much. Now that I look back, some weeks I probably played for over 20 hours which was more than the time I played piano and danced ballet combined. Of course we still played, but not to the degree that we were at the time. PSA game addiction is a dangerous thing and is not to be meddled with, if your parents ask you to stop, please stop, if your friends ask you to stop, then you know you’ve stepped too far, and you really should stop. </p>
<p>Half a year later, ROTMG was sold to DECA games. Many people were hoping that the game would actually have updates and be more interesting and oh boy did it. DECA released so many free packs and created a login calendar. And on the very first calendar, if you logged in everyday for the entire month, you get a character slot and vault chest. I was ecstatic. I logged in everyday and got my hands on the character slot unlocker the most valuable item in the game. </p>
<p>I started to tackle the lag problem piece by piece and soon enough, I figured out a solution: flash projector. I could now play at 50FPS with 7 net jitter and I never saw lag tiles. It was a huge upgrade from the original 25 FPS and 2500 net jitter.</p>
<p class = "phase">Skilled: </p>
<p>Now, I was on a roll! I was getting good at the game and could max stats quicker, do dungeons more efficiently, and got rare drops. Months and months passed and I got more and more character slots, vault chests, loot, and soon enough I joined a guild: “T-Lex.” This was the first time I had ever talked to strangers online in a voice call on Discord. But, I was not disappointed. It was an amazing guild and I grew attached to it. I remember Jootan’s stories, Yasumeii’s constantly doing stupid things, Argocyte’s hilarious imitations, Commetdash’s serene demeanor, etc. It felt like a family. We would do dungeons together and when we finally defeated the final boss, it was rewarding, not because of the loot, but because we did it together.</p>
<p>The lost halls was announced. The hardest dungeon in ROTMG was almost here to production. At this point, most of my irl friends had quit realm and those who didn’t were on the brink, but I kept going. I found out about LHZ, a new discord for lost halls. There were people called “Raid Leaders” that led the “raid” on a dungeon. I looked up to these people who knew so much about the dungeon and guided hundreds of people through dungeons. I’ll never forget my first lost halls. It was terrifying. I listened to everything the calm raid leader said but my butt cheeks were clenched and sweating. At the end of the dungeon I was so relieved.</p>
<p>I started to find out more about discords and joined a few more such as EDZ, Event dungeons (just random dungeons), and SHZ, Shatters (the previous hardest dungeon). People who paid money would buy keys and open them for the discords and we would clear dungeons easily as a group. One day, I opened discord and EDZ, SHZ, and LHZ were all gone. The owner of these discords was pissed off by many ungrateful players and had had enough so he just disbanded them. LHZ had more than 6 thousand members at its peek. So I came across new discords: pub halls and pub shatts.</p>
<p>I remember doing runs in these discords to get loads of loot. Though I still was nervous when going into the halls, I noticed I was getting rather good at Shatters.</p>
<p class = "phase">Leader: </p>
<p>I knew Shatters like the back of my hand, layout, rushing, attack patterns, everything. So I applied to be a raid leader. After being accepted, I had to prove I could lead a group in a couple trial runs before officially getting the role. That first trial run, I was nervous as hell. I tried to emulate the same calm attitudes of other raid leaders and I definitely knew what I was doing. I ultimately led the group through the shatters with 0 deaths.</p>
<p>After a couple more trials with head raid leaders looking over me I got promoted. I never realized how much fun it was to lead. The number of dms that I have saying “I love you best rl!” are innumerable and I felt loved.</p>
<p class = "phase">Moderator: </p>
<p>The responsibilities in my role included security work. This meant I had uphold rules and suspend people from the discord for disobeying the rules. I thought the bulk of people that I would have to suspend were people who were too undergeared, but sadly that was not the case. The bulk of people I had to suspend were those using racial slurs.</p>
<p>Sometimes I had to even suspend my fellow leaders. One time, I heard a head raid leader, someone 1 rank higher than me, say the n-word in a raiding channel and was toxic in chat. [Note: the ROTMG community I grew up with was very loving giving free items out all the time and I emulated their behavior as I got better with the game. This toxicity was unheard of in my book.] So I reported him to the admin. He was kicked from the discord and has held a grudge with me ever since. Another rl was undergeared in my run and a head raid leader, hrl, caught him. That rl told the hrl that I allowed it and the hrl raised his eyebrows. He dragged me into the call with the other rl server muted and after explaining I didn’t know, the hrl suspended the rl and told me I needed to be more careful.</p>
<p class = "phase">Godly: </p>
<p>I was getting really good at the game. I could rush dungeons easily, had the best gear, was giving so much free stuff away, and was a respected member in the community. I got another friend into realm: Eddie and we had fun times together. Eddie was probably my only irl friend that ever got to a level comparable to mine in realm. Ultimately when T-Lex disbanded, I had to find another guild to join. That guild was Txt. It was very fun, but my time with realm was coming to a close.</p>
<p class = "phase">Bored: </p>
<p>Now let me address hacking. Hackers have always been in the community and ever since I started playing, there have been spambots telling me hacked client websites with autoaim and safe guards that allow you to basically never die. To be honest, I didn’t mind cheaters, but then I found out how many there were. So many people cheated and I questioned the validity of the the game.</p>
<p>Once you get really good at a game, you get bored. I had so much good gear that I just dropped some on the floor so I could save space. All I needed to do was farm those hard dungeons to hope to get that really good 0.1% dropchance loot. Txt was starting to fade. The number of cheaters also made me question why I was even playing the game legit. I started to lean away from the game. The discords seemed to just be milking the game, there wasn’t a battle anymore, just “ez dungeon ez loot.” I felt bad for Eddie, he never experienced those times where the journey was the most enjoyable part not the loot. My guildies would just be concerned with getting loot and not trying to get a challenge. I even tried so many realm challenges, but there wasn’t a challenge anymore and the game was no longer fun. I stepped down from my rl position in the beginning of junior year and didn’t play for half a year.</p>
<p class = "phase">Nostalgia: </p>
<p>I played realm starting 2nd semester junior year and the unity port of realm made it possible for me to play 60 FPS. I started to have another revamp into realm since there was so much new content that was created while I was gone, but soon enough. Boredom. I was just too good and felt like Saitama from One Punch Man. Combine this with the frequent random disconnects with unity and I just stopped.</p>
<p>I will never forget the memories I made with it. It’s been 6 years with this game and I hope the positivity that nurtured me stays and the toxicity stays low. </p>
