<h1 id = "title">The Fake Gay (without redactions)</h1>
<p>This story is the full story of my relationship with “Gloria.” The redacted version is on the public stories titled “The Fake Gay.” I’m still going to tell the full story so you don’t need to read that one. If you read that story feel free to skip to areas that I’ve marked where the story differs.</p>
<p>This story starts with a plane ride to a robotics competition in sophomore year. I had convinced my parents to let me go on this trip and I was filled with excitement.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the airport, I noticed her. She looked cute with fine proportions and a young face, but I didn’t think too much of her. We then had to board a bus to go on a long ride over to the hotel at Flagstaff. I sat near her and so took the initiative and introduced myself to her. She was a very sweet freshman and her name was, well fake name for this story, Gloria. </p>
<p>I started to get to know her better. Note: 50% of the people going on the trip I had never actually seen which is absolutely ridiculous, but you know, college apps; she is included. The actual competition was boring as hell for me because I wasn’t part of the actual board that worked with the robot 24/7 (concerning robot parts, I was just part of the build team), but her presence made it a whole lot more interesting. I thought her personality was very intriguing and, to all you vague idiots that just say “oH i liEK hER pERsOnALiTY,” I loved most that she was never scared to express emotion. This attribute allowed us to talk fairly freely and it wasn’t long until </p>
<p class = "quotes">"Wait make that face again when you eat the noodles!"<br>
    “Show me, show me!” [Laughter]<br>
    “You should send that to me!” She gave me a smirk.<br>
    “Oh boy you are smooth.”  </p>
<p class = "phase">[This is where it differs]</p>
<p>The 3 days before the trip ended, she and one of her guy friends were having a very serious talk. When I approached, I noticed she looked very sad. I turned to the guy and asked,</p>
<p class = "quotes">
    “What’s Gloria pouting about?”<br>
    “Well, its secret, I don’t think you should get involved.” This was a clear “back off, my girl.” <br>
    “Well if you need to talk, I’m here, after all I’m your senpai!” I winked and began to leave.<br>
    “Wait, could you sit here?”<br></p>
<p>She pointed to a spot opposite her. I sat down. After a moment of apprehension, I got out my copy of Julius Caesar and began to read. “I love treason but-” suddenly she began to explain with her friend calming her and aiding her in describing what had occurred. The gist was that someone had picked her up after she fell in an inappropriate manner, held her there for a bit before dropping her down. In the moment she didn’t say anything, didn’t ask why but I’d assume due to shock, and he never apologized nor think he did anything wrong. Now, that person was in this trip. I slyly asked for his name and got it. Let’s call him “Jason.” </p>
<p>I didn’t know what to make of what I had heard, but since at the time I had heard of many cases of false sexual assault claims, I had suspicions. This is when I began to talk to Jason. He was a guy who had a superiority complex, but it wasn’t unnatural for a guy his age to have one. He was the type of guy to expect to get great power quickly. He was shy at first, but could get extremely chatty. I had an okay impression on this guy but then “VOOSH” a Nerf bullet wooshed passed my ear barely missing my head. I get migraines easily and I ain’t riskin’ anything, I immediately ducked down and shouted “Hold your fire!”</p>
<p>A group of imbeciles bought nerf guns from the local store to mess around at the hotel. Guess who was with them: main man Jason. Yeah man, have fun going through the TSA with those. I chastised them and glared at each one, but to no avail. The boy who shot it near me didn’t even apologize and maintained “it wasn’t even close bro, stop freaking out.” Then a chaperone came out and I knew it wasn’t my problem to handle anymore.</p>
<p>Two days left ’til we went back and I pondered on what to do with the information she told me. She explicitly begged me not to inform anyone, but avoiding problems and hiding from them is a terrible idea. PSA: anyone tells you they got a sexual harassment or assault problem, tell an authority. At this time, I began to talk to a senior officer more often and I respected him in many ways. Suvan loved music, in fact he goes to Oberlin, and he had a very intellectual view on the world. Another girl (forgot her name, oops), let’s call her “Katherine,” also tagged along in our conversations. She was a shy junior Korean girl that wasn’t as wise, but still a very passionate and intellectual speaker.</p>
<p>The night before we left, I knocked on Suvan’s room and asked if I could talk to him. As I began to tell him the story, one of his roomates came in and ushered us out because he wanted to sleep, so we went searching for another private room [there was a party in my room because my roommate is an idiot and welcomed in 15 people without telling me]. Luckily, Katherine’s room was nearly empty. All her roommates were elsewhere and so I divulged. When I finished, Suvan and Katherine contended that I needed to tell Heather, the main organizer/parent volunteer. My heart was telling me “no” because this meant game over with any relation with Gloria. </p>
<p class = "phase">“But think about it, you show so much more care for her by doing the right thing even if she thinks it isn’t right, right now.” </p>
<p>I went over and told Heather the full story with Suvan and Katherine there for moral support. Heather gestured for us get Jason. We found him, and told him to talk to Heather. A few moments later, Heather went to our room and asked us to find Gloria. We did. I saw her laughing on the bed that we both sat on when she invited me into the room to chat. I gathered my breath and said “Gloria, Heather wants to talk to you for a bit.” Her amusement turned to horror in less than a second. She rushed out.</p>
<p>“You didn’t tell her right?” Her face was pale and her eyes were bubbling with tears. My heart pained to look at her face, but I said in a steady tone looking her straight in the eye “this is for the best.” She kept shaking her head, tears fully formed and dripping on the carpet. Suvan grabbed my shoulder and said, “let’s head back, you did what was best for her and that takes sheer will.” That night I slept at 3am because of a long conversation with Suvan and the junior, the party in my room, and my sleepless reminisce of what memories were lost.</p>
<p>The next day as I was helping to put luggage into the bus’s compartment I took her luggage and she looked embarrassed. I kept up a positive attitude and was cheery on the way to the airport. At the airport, I demanded a 37 cent deduction on my burger due to there not being cheese present because of my milk allergy. As I was happily prancing back to the terminal without any loose change in my pocket, just bills, I saw her coming back as well with a bowl of rice and something from Panda Express. </p>
<p class = "quotes">“They had burgers?! Why didn’t you tell me?” <br>
    “Ew, Panda Express? Who eats that?” <br>
    “Hey, it’s actually good though!” <br> </p>
<p>Instant renewal? On the plane ride over I sat next to her older sister, a CMU undergrad at the moment, and asked her if she knew about the situation. She thanked me then proceeded to ignore me until I pulled out my phone and scrolled through pictures of my dog. She immediately took my phone and said “OMG is this your dog?! I love dogs!” We started to talk and when the conversation shifted to Gloria, her sister gave me an annoyed look and said “my sister literally has a harem of guys chasing her around. Good luck boy, maybe you’re the one for her?” Fun fact, the other guy seated next to me told us that he was going to change his name because of very personal and emotional reasons. I felt a great deal of sympathy for him and told him to do what he believed was right. Only now do I realize that this is the same guy who nearly shot me with a nerf gun.</p>
<p class = "phase">[End of difference]</p>

 <p>When we started going back to school, we texted now and then. Not all too much because I started to notice she began to seem like all those other girls at school. No longer as open and more closed, but I pretended not to notice and kept starting conversations only to realize it was much harder to keep them going than in person.</p>
<p>At school she sometimes asked to hug me which I found cute at first, but she hugged all her friends which didn't make me feel as special. I tried to get in with her girl group and here’s a memory that makes me want to kill myself</p>
<p class = "quotes">“Why are you even here?” <br>
    “Because Gloria’s here.” <br>
    “Why are you so energetic?” <br>
    “Well, what do you expect? I’m in front of a boatload of girls!”</p>
<p>This phrase that would’ve made all the girls at ballet laugh was not the move and the ensuing silence affirmed that. You know how many better things I could’ve said? Like 10000000. I chose the worst option possible for literally no reason.</p>
<p>One day, she asks if I want to go on a hike together. I was ecstatic, was this my first “date?” I asked who else would be going. “Oh another couple.” Wait, that implies we were a couple. My immature brain was sending dopamine signals all over the place.</p>
<p>“Aight I’m in.” Three days before we go, she informs me that one of them can’t go. Two days before, she tells me the other can’t and it’d just be us. Pause. Her dad is supposed to drive us. Think. Okay. Asian Girl’s Father is driving his daughter and a boy over to hike. Is that logical? This doesn’t happen. Play. I ask her if her dad would still be okay with driving us. She replies “of course.” After asking for an explanation to the logical fallacy she replies </p>
<p class = "quotes">“Oh I told him you dance ballet, so he thinks you’re gay!”</p>
<p>Man, that was hilarious. The actual hike was D tier. The only interesting thing was that she took off her shirt and walked in a sports bra. And that’s not even that interesting. Somehow we couldn’t converse as we used to. But of course I played it up to my friends telling them how exciting such a dull experience was. </p>
<p>We began to drift apart after the hike, no intense break but I would text her less, walk her back home less, and give her cookies less. One day, she texted me that she found a hot guy at our school and really wanted to get with him. I realized this was her version of a “friend zone” (more like acquaintance zone) but as a good friend I gave her all the tips and tricks. The first of which was to find out if he had a girlfriend already. And he did. Oof.</p>
<p>Suddenly she asked me if I wanted to go for another hike. Mmm, girl, sorry that’s not how it works with true relationships let’s say it together:</p>
<p class = "quotes"> <b>“you either choose me or you lose me, I ain’t nobody’s plan B”</b></p>
<p>I just said, “I’m busy.” Which was true. </p>
