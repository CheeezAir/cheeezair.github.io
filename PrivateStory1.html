<h1 id = "title">My Friend, Ivan</h1>

<p>This story is about a friend, Ivan. I was friends with him for over 6 years and this story is about why we split. Some notes before diving in, most “we”s include Ayush, Ansen, and I. Ivan was constantly making suicide jokes and didn’t stop even when I asked him to so something was up. He was about to ask a girl out to prom and had hoped that he could get in the same college as her: UCLA. Let us begin?</p>
<p>“OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! SHE SAID ‘YES’!” Ivan was freaking out next to me in American Studies. It was unlike him to act this crazy, but I congratulated him: the girl he asked to prom said yes. I was slightly confused why he was freaking out so much, but he told me in a voice so jovial and shocked that he “didn’t think she’d say yes!” I was happy for him and patted him on the back. He already made the poster and bought a stuffed animal, he was all geared up to do a “true” asking that Friday.  Sadly, I was sick that day and didn’t get to witness it happening, but later watched a fairly cringy, awkward video of Ivan giving his poster and a stuffed animal to her. </p>
<p>Suddenly we received a text from Ivan saying that he asked her if she wanted take their relationship further, but she told him she didn’t see it that way. This was the start of Ivan’s quick descent from 100 to 0. Ivan’s standards are high enough such that he respected her decision, but through the week, he told us that he felt she kept trying to distance herself from him. On their group chats he would always send the last messages and she wouldn’t ever initiate conversations. Note: This doesn’t mean much to me and I would’ve kept holding strong relationship with anyone I wanted to be friends with and would’ve even bluntly asked if the other person wanted me to be their friend but to Ivan it meant a lot. He took this as a sign that she may have only accepted his promposal pity. </p>
<p>Ivan was not a great student. I remember carrying him in 3 group projects in 8th grade, all of which were not good experiences. He constantly procrastinated and at this point was almost 3 weeks late on a lit assignment. Moreover, Ivan wasn’t responsible: nearly every class in high school I had with him he would ask “what was the homework?” At first I was fine with it, but I started to detest being treated as Schoolloop. I told him to stop asking me, but he would keep doing so and it began to piss me off. But that was light compared to an event that happened a couple months prior.</p>
<p>We noticed that Ivan was not the best student so we wanted to help him out. I did my part by always asking him if he wanted to study together. We could do work together and be productive. However, this rarely happened. I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt and say that his parents always blocked him from working at my house. In lit we had an essay exam we had to prepare for, we had two weeks to prepare for it. So as his friend, I asked him if he wanted to prepare together.</p>
<p>“Later.” Meh, I thought I might as well prepare a bit myself first. I began to find quotes from the book to work. A week passed and I asked him the same question. “Later.” Okay, I mean he might be busy and that’s fine. I started to outline possible essays I could write for possible prompts I had predicted. Two days before, </p>
<p class="quotes">
    “Bro, I’m really stressed about this essay.” <br>
    “Same! You wanna work on an outline together today?”<br>
    “Mmm, I think I’m busy.” <br></p>
<p>During lunch, we usually hung out together, but for those two days Ivan hung out with another group of friends. If he was with us I would’ve asked him to work on it during lunch as well. The day of the exam brunch:<br>
    “Richard help me prepare for the exam!” I was looking at a jojo’s shitpost that another friend had showed me and I ignored Ivan. I was angry. You’re asking me now? Asking me in the last 5 minutes, my destress time? Instead of all that other time I gave you? Yeah no, you can fuck off.</p>
<p>That day Ivan types in our chat “I’m so stressed out.” So I respond </p>
<p class = "quotes">“What’s up?”<br>
	“idk maybe one of the reasons is that i actually need a good grade on that essay exam and I don’t feel good about it. Maybe cuz someone was too busy looking at jojo’s to care about me.” <br> </p>
<p>I proceeded to send him a huge essay on why I ignored him explaining that I hated procrastination and he needed to take opportunities when they arose, however I also apologized for ignoring him. I sincerely told him that I was immature for ignoring him, but that he should also realize his own faults. Then, he proceeded to say “I don’t wanna argue with you, I’m busy” and leave the chat. Being the idiot I was, I took the bait and dragged him back in only for him to hold all the power say “I really don’t have the patience to argue with you” and leave. At this point I should’ve realized that if he was truly busy he would’ve turned off his phone and got down to work, but somehow he responded. But I was blind and tried once more until Ansen and Ayush told me to stop. </p>
<p>The next day, I sat next to Ivan and at first he looked away from me. But slowly he looked towards me and acknowledged my presence, gave me sheepish look, and I added him back to the chat. Complete silence and false renewal. He never brought this moment back up again and he never apologized to me. He hid from this issue and I clearly remember telling Ayush and Ansen that this was the first explosion not the last. </p>
<p>Now, combine his lack of academic responsibility with his gaming addictions. Ivan plays League of Legends. And as with any multiplayer game, the toxicity can get extremely high. This may have had an impact on Ivan. But the biggest impact was the time it consumed. It seemed that games were the only thing that gave Ivan relief from life. It was so bad that we even asked him to control himself. When your friends tell you to stop playing a game, you need to stop. </p>
<p>The scene is set. His gunpowder was there and then that friendzone the spark that made him depressed. He would seek solace in other things that weren't school related such as games, but he also began to hang out a lot with a girl that I liked at the time. A lot. In fact he hung out with her more than I did so naturally she liked him more than me and suddenly she switched onto the Ivan boat. Now, Ivan's reaction to this was "surprise," but I have to say that this was the beginning of my true understanding of his personality. After quarantine began, he stopped caring about school; he had no reason to care. He began to talk about suicide and depression more and more often. We knew we had to console him and for two months we were trying. His idea was that the world didn’t matter, whatever you did now doesn’t matter in the end, so why do anything. What was the point in living? To that I answer that who gives 2 shits about what happens when you’re gone? When you’re gone nothing’s interesting anymore, you should only care about the present because that is what is malleable. That is what you can make interesting. But no, after 3 midnight talks from me, a million minutes spent thinking about him and helping him get motivated with school work, he didn’t budge.</p>
<p>So, we decided to seek adult help and turned to Ms. Clausi, my very understanding lit teacher, and Mr. Schmidt, the student advocate. Mr. Dong, our school’s assistant principal, called his parents and Ivan, I’m not sure how he got Ivan’s number, and we thought that was the beginning of the end of his depression. We thought. After that, we took him on a walk for 3 hours to let him rant and feel the sunshine, but all that really happened during that walk was him sighing a lot and everyone else trying to ignore it and crack jokes. That is not to say we didn’t try to urge him to talk to us about it. Every minute, the question was raised for him to tell us about his situation, and every time he would either say “I don’t feel like it” in which case we’d stop for a few minutes. Or he would say some analogy which was not specific that didn’t clarify anything and it really seemed as if he had given up so much hope that he lost the ability to critically think. This is not Ivan. </p>
<p>Then one night, during another midnight call, he told me he told Sydney about his situation and told me that she was “surprisingly nice” about it. I wondered why he told Sydney in the first place, but I got him to write an email to his teachers explaining the situation. He was extremely adamant about not sending the email, but I still made him send it. I’m gonna be blunt the email was not specific and didn’t have any goals set, but he sent it to Sydney and she edited it to make it look a whole lot better. Then his teachers gave him extensions, which you would think are good things, but no, for some reason he started to be even more lax. He even admitted to laziness, and his reasoning was that he didn’t see a point and he didn’t “feel like it.“ He said that everyone who studied was useless to the world and that it was useless in the end. This theme of uselessness caught on and even though we kept emphasizing that life was valuable since it was short, he kept shunning those ideas out and grasping onto his own. He also kept saying that he had no accomplishments, again and again, and every time we told him, </p>
<p class = "phase">“then go work and get one!” </p>
<p>We tried to at least get him to feel like he was accomplished in school, but he would always try to run away from his problems by playing a game, going invisible on discord, saying extremely stupid things like “evening is before afternoon?” and many other concerning actions. As our worry deepened, his mom called me and asked us to help Ivan with his homework. Wait not help, babysit him, she told us to “sit with him and watch the CS videos” and “do the homework with him and if you don’t share a class help him either way.” Ivan was extremely behind on work and the time was very busy: we were less than a month until APs. We were wanted to support Ivan, but we could not fill all these demands, and this is when I started to burn out. We got on a call with Ivan and made a schedule for him and, in that schedule, we scheduled times to individually work with him on his work. Even though we constantly asked that he work with us, he would just ignore us and it was really getting on our nerves. We didn’t want to chase after him and we didn’t want him to suffer, so we asked his mom to seek professional help. But, his mom kept emphasizing for us to help and was relying on us to be his mom. I couldn’t man, its just too much. </p>
<p>My mental state was deteriorating. Every call with his mom, my feet and face grew cold, my heart beated faster than ever, and my nights were filled with nightmares of him committing suicide and anguish of not ignoring my work to instead help him. When I talked with him, I prayed with all my will he would listen and I would have headaches from my sheer will for any piece of hope. I even got a migraine from worrying about him so much. All this was combined with intense studying for AP exams and if it weren’t for the blessing that is unlimited sleep during quarantine, I would’ve died. </p>
<p>We began to push Ivan to work, but he just wouldn’t stick to the schedule. He would always do something else and okay, sure if you’re going to do something else and be independent, good for you! Why did we need to help you? We started to stop bugging him and let him do his work by himself, this also gave us time to work on our own things. But then he messaged me about the CS homework due a week ago [he didn’t take initiative his mom pushed him]. Uh oh, he treated me like schoolloop again. I’m not a robot, so I politely suggested that he check schoolloop. He was fairly rude back to me and demanded an answer from me. Then, I told him I didn’t know what it was since I did the homework a long time ago, but he took it the wrong way. </p>
<p class= "quotes">“Do you think I’m talking about last week’s hw?”</p>
<p>It was a mistake. Except he didn’t want to admit it. Instead, he said, “you know what it’s fine.“ Yeah, fine for me too I guess. My fuel was exhausted. Two days later, we had sent him texts in every group chat we had asking something along the lines of</p>
<p class="phase">“how’s the work going? You doing okay?”</p>
<p>I had been depressed before. I had the same rationale he had. At first, I saw my own reflection in him and desperately tried to pull him out, but then I looked a little deeper. It confused me why he would share his depressed information with someone that he really didn’t know too much. It also confused me why he couldn’t hear us. He refused to listen to our rationale, I even did the guilt trip “if you committed suicide, that would hurt us a lot and it’s selfish.” Was this just an act to be lazy? </p>
<p>A week before APs started, Ivan sent us a video that was really scary. It said something along the lines that he was really depressed and really sorry for everything and “thanks for everything.“ In my heart I knew there was no way Ivan could kill himself, but I panicked and we ultimately called the nonemergency line. A police man came over to his house and talked with him, but as you will see he didn’t really do much. After the police left his house, we went over to check up on him and go on a walk. Again like every other time it was very depressing, he would just keep sighing again and again, hunching his shoulders. But we had a new strategy this time: we needed to implement force. No person toughens up without feeling pain and the only people willing enough to force him to strengthen up were his friends. We tried to force him to stand up straight. But no. He was too lazy?</p>
<p>I noticed the whenever we made fun of someone, Ivan would laugh, but wouldn’t show positive emotions otherwise. We walked over to a nearby park and tried to pry him to talking to us about his life. But, of course he wouldn’t so we decided, to make him run and get the blood moving a bit. He hadn’t gone outside for more than 2 days which is not very good for your mental state. Thing is, he would only pick at the grass. That’s it, he wouldn’t talk in an audible tone or anything. No matter if we physically pulled him up or started to get him stand up with words of encouragement, nothing happened, he would just sit right back down and pick at the grass. We had all had enough of this crap and Ansen took Ivan’s water bottle and poured the water onto Ivan. We were just going to be some crazed teens running about a park; that’s the perk of youth. Ivan’s scream of shock and excitement was the loudest thing for the whole meeting, but once we pointed out that he could run and could talk, he tried his best to return to his depressed self. After finishing that bottle of water which was only half full to begin with, we had nothing left to do and Ivan ignored us. So I said</p>
<p class = "quotes">
    “You know what hurts Ivan is when you think grass is more important than me.” <br>
    After a moment, he replied extremely softly and looked me right in the eye “You know what hurts is when you didn’t even consider me as a partner for the CS project.” He tried to start to walk away but, at this point I had had enough with this selfish bullshit so I ran in front of him and demanded <br>
    “can I be myself? My egotistical self for a moment?” <br>
    “I don’t know.”<br>
    “Yes, yes I can, do you think you are a good team member?“<br>
    “I don’t know what do you think?” Anger flashed in his eyes.<br>
    “No you are not, from all the projects that I’ve ever done with you I have never had 1 good experience. Do you think I’m an idiot?”<br>
    “I don’t know what do you think?” More aggressive this time.<br>
    “I asked you the question, but no I do not consider myself an idiot and therefore I learn from my mistakes. Do you think it would be healthy for me to partner with you through an entire CS project during APs?” <br>
    “…” he began to walk away and he put in his earbuds. I walked at a brisk pace in front of him.<br>
    “Ivan, do you really want to stay the person you are right now? Wouldn’t you rather be someone that others can rely on, not the one who always needs others?” He pretended to ignore me.<br>
    “You can’t run away from this problem,” said Ansen.<br>
    “You can’t run away from anything, this will come back to you,” Ayush repeated.<br>
    But he just kept walking. So I said, “Ivan, I know you want attention.”<br>
    He jerked his head and glared at me and instantly replied “If I wanted attention I would’ve started to cut myself.”<br>
    “No you wouldn’t,” I replied looking him right back in the eyes, “You don’t have the balls.” <br>
    He looked agitated. “But Ivan, there’s nothing wrong with wanting attention, and in fact all of us here are slaves to attention. Look at me a ballet dancer, Ansen a pianist, and Ayush in leadership, but there are wrong and right ways of getting attention. My point is, please don’t hurt yourself.” <br></p>
<p>His shoulders relaxed and he kept on sulking. We followed him up until 2 blocks away from his house at which point we stopped and started to talk amongst ourselves. We looked in his direction to see if he’d look back, and he didn’t, but what did I expect? </p>
<p>Did Schmidt/the police/his therapist/the counselor do anything? Who knows. Ivan reply to any of our messages for the next month. I was in a group for Amstuds with him and our group had to make a video with him. He took years to respond to any of the groups messages and ultimately we did do the recording. I tried to ask how he was at the end of the meeting, but he just said “wat” and left the meeting.</p>
<p>APs were now over and we could help him if he wanted. But we had enough chasing him. He could find us if he needed help, but he didn’t and those were extremely peaceful times. </p>
<p>Suddenly after a month of curving us, he responds to Ayush’s personal dms: </p>
<p class= "quotes">
    “How’s it going” (1 month ago) <br>
	“what?” <br>
</p>
<p>Soon enough, Ayush asks him why he took so long to respond. He aggresively asked “idk why do you think? Maybe cuz I was busy with APs and school work.” APs were over for a month and any extension you may have gotten must have ended more than 2 weeks ago and same for school work. It was ridiculous. Ultimately Ayush made the right play by simply backing out and saying “if you aren’t happy talking to me then don’t.” Ivan tried using the strategy he used to lure me in, but Ayush didn’t take it. Instead Ayush respectfully backed out while Ivan was telling him to “go fuck” himself and called him “plastic” for saying those respectful things. I will say that I believe Ayush meant those things. </p>
<p>I was there the whole time reading my friend’s dms through a private discord stream and I was pissed. I applaud Ayush for staying calm through it all. If Ivan had instead dm’d me I probably would still be wallowing in worry. I texted a close friend fo his and explained the situation then asked how Ivan was doing. His friend was shocked by Ivan’s behavior, but told us that Ivan seemed to be fine. In fact he had just went to a birthday party. (May I add during quarantine?) I was glad that he was happy. We all still wish the best for Ivan wherever he goes.</p>
<p>It still hurts to know he wishes my burning, torture in purgatory (Ivan likes Ayush > Ansen > me), but I’ll be much happier without him either! </p>
<p class="phase">The hole he used to occupy in my heart is filling with the wisdom that came from this experience.</p>
